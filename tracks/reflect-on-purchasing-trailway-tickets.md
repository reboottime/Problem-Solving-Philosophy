# My reflection on purchasing trail way ticket

## The process should be

- seek information and do reality check (understand the problem in how to solve it of 4 steps)
  - core questions:
    - what is known and unknown
    - what is the hard constraint and risk
    - what is the goal
  - why we need reality check step: human can mixture facts and assumptions in communications,LLM can jump in quick conclusion and take what people said as facts
  - This is an iterative process and requires reality check as new information may invalidate
- break the whole travel journey into detailed steps
  - report table format
    - step name
    - operation time
    - possible delay by what with what rate
    - Optimal deadline
    - Hard deadline
    - consequence if miss hard deadline to overall process success rate
  - If you are using AI, we also need reality check to above information
- work backwards and do reality check

## Some thoughts

- It is very similar to the logical thinking process.
- do reality check early
- avoid analysis paralysis to reversible decision

analysis paralysis might be a symptom of lacking systematic problem solving methods.

Deep seek suggested integrating people layer in this process

In a conversation with Deep seek,

- Step 1: Power Map with stakeholder icons (Godfather üëë, Ally üõ°Ô∏è, Enemy üí£)
- Step 2: Killer Stakeholder ‚ò†Ô∏è with mitigation strategy
- step 3: Pre-mortem showing political failure scenarios
